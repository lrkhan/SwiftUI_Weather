# ForcastME (SwiftUI Weather)

ForcastME is a Detroit Weather app built with Swift/SwiftUI.

The purpose of the app is to practice data modeling and API calls.
The API used in this project is [OpenWeather's One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

The icons used for the app are from [Yorlmar Campos](https://iconstore.co/author/yorlmar-campos).

Both Metric and Imperial units are available for the user in the app.

My API key is NOT INCLUDED in the project.
